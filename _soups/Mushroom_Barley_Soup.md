# Ingredients

- Extra virgin olive oil 
- 16 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
- Kosher salt
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 8 oz white mushrooms, chopped
- ½ cup canned crushed tomatoes
- Black pepper
- 1 tsp coriander
- ½ tsp to ¾ tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp cumin
- 6 cups low-sodium broth (vegetable broth or beef broth)
- 1 cup pearl barley rinsed
- ½ cup packed chopped parsley

# Directions

1. In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add sliced cremini mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.
2. In the same pot, add a little more olive oil. Add onions, garlic, celery, carrots, and chopped white mushrooms. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes over medium-high heat. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Add crushed tomatoes and spices (coriander, smoked paprika, cumin). Cook for 3 minutes or so, tossing regularly.
4. Add broth and pearl barley. Bring to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, then turn heat down. Cover and let simmer over low heat for about 45 minutes until the barley is tender and cooked through.
5. Add the cooked cremini mushrooms back to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for about 5 minutes,  until mushrooms are well warmed through.
6. Finish with fresh parsley & serve.
