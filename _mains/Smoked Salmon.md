# Ingredients

- ~2 lbs Salmon filet
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup coarse sea salt
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ to 1 cup wood chips (cedar or hickory)

# Directions

1. Combine the brown sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Put about ⅓ of it on the bottom of a baking pan, set the salmon on top and cover the salmon with the remaining sugar-salt mixture.
2. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. The mixture will pull out moisture from the salmon and infuse it with flavor, helping create the distinctive extremely firm, slightly sweet flavor of traditionally smoked salmon.
3. Put the wood chips in a large bowl, cover them with water, and let them soak at least 30 minutes. Drain and put them in a smoker box or tin foil.
4. Prepare grill for indirect heat:

    **For gas grills:** heat one side of grill to 250 F. Set a foil-wrapped pan, with about an inch of water, under the cooking grate on the non-heated side. 

    **For charcoal grills:** light a fire. When the coals are ready, push them to one side and set a foil-wrapped pan with about an inch of water in it on the other side of a coal grate.

5. Put the wood chip container over the hot part of the grill.
6. Rinse the salmon from its sugar-salt mixture, pat it dry, and set it skin-side-down on tin foil over the cool side of the grill (above the pan of water). 
7. Cover and cook until the salmon is fully smoked and flaky & internal temperature is 125 F (about 30-60 minutes, depending on thickness of salmon).
