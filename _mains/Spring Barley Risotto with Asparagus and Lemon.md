# ingredients 

- 2¾ cups vegetable broth or water and 1 vegetable bouillon cube
- ⅛ teaspoon saffron threads, slightly crumbled
- 10 medium asparagus stalks, tough ends removed
- 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced into 1⁄4 inch dice
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely minced
- 1 cup pearled barley
- ½ cup white wine, Sauvignon Blanc or Viognier
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- 15 grindings of black pepper, or to taste
- Finely grated zest from 1⁄2 lemon (about 1 teaspoon)
- ½–¾ cup grated fresh Parrano or Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup toasted, slivered almonds (1 Tablespoon removed for garnish)

# Directions

1. Combine the broth and the crushed saffron threads in a 1-quart pot and bring to a simmer.
2. Meanwhile, cut the asparagus stalks on a diagonal into ½-inch pieces, reserving 1½ inches
3. of the tip.
4. When the liquid is simmering, drop in the asparagus stalk pieces and blanch for 2 minutes, until they’re bright green and slightly tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a small glass bowl. Add the tips to the broth and cook for 1 minute, then remove from the broth and set aside.
5. Keep the broth warm over low heat while you prepare the barley.
6. Heat a 3-quart saucepan over high heat for 10 seconds. Add the extra virgin olive oil and heat for another 10 seconds. Mix in the onion and garlic and reduce the heat to medium. Sauté the mixture for about 4 minutes, until the onions and garlic are slightly golden.
7. Add the barley and stir to coat.
8. Pour in the wine, stirring constantly until it is absorbed.
9. Add all of the simmering broth, stir, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Stirring the mixture every 5 minutes or so to prevent sticking and burning, cook for 30–35 minutes, until the barley is tender. If all of the liquid has been absorbed and the barley appears too hard and/or dry, add another 1⁄4 cup of water and cook for 5 more minutes.
10. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the salt, pepper, and lemon zest until well combined.
11. Gently stir the grated cheese into the mixture. When it is evenly distributed and melted, add the almonds and the reserved asparagus pieces minus 5 asparagus tips.
12. Immediately serve the barley risotto in a dish garnished with the reserved Tablespoon of almonds and the 5 asparagus tips.
