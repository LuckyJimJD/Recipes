# Ingredients 

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 6 large leeks
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- ½ cup breadcrumbs or matzo meal
- ½ teaspoon allspice or nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper or chili flakes
- vegetable oil for frying

# Directions 

1. Slice leeks lengthwise and rinse in cold water to clean thoroughly, then slice thinly crosswise. 
2. Saute leeks in skillet with olive oil over medium-high flame until soft (about 5 minutes). Allow leeks to cool.  
3. Combine leeks, egg, salt, breadcrumbs, and spices. Mixture should be just firm enough to form into patties. If too wet, add breadcrumbs; if too dry, add egg. 
4. Fry in about ¼- ½ inch of vegetable oil over medium heat until evenly browned and crisp on both sides. Remove with slotted spoon and place on paper towel to drain. 
5. Season with salt and pepper and serve with lemon slices. 

## Makes about 12 large patties
