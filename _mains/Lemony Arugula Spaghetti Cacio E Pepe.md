# Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 12 ounces dried spaghetti
- ¼ pound pancetta or bacon, finely diced (about ¾ cup)
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic (about 4 big cloves)
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more to taste
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 1½ cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving
- 3 cups baby arugula

# Directions 

1. In a large pot of heavily salted boiling water, cook the spaghetti to al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.
2. In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium-high heat until crisp, 7-9 minutes. 
3. Add the olive oil, then add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Add the lemon juice to the skillet, then toss in the drained pasta and toss to coat. 
5. Add the Parmigiano and toss, adding pasta water, a little at a time, to help the cheese coat the pasta. 
6. Add the arugula and toss until it wilts, about 1 minute. Season to taste with additional salt, lots of black pepper, and red pepper flakes. 
7. Sprinkle additional Parmigiano on top and serve.
