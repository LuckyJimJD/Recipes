title: ﻿Dr. Pepper Braised Short Ribs with Butternut Squash Risotto

---

#### Serves 4 

# Ingredients 

- 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 short ribs sections, 12 ounces each, trimmed of excess fat
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 8 large shallots, peeled, trimmed, split, rinsed and dried
- 2 medium-sized carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths
- 2 ribs of celery, peeled, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths
- 1 medium-sized leek (white and light-green parts), coarsely chopped, washed and dried
- 10 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 2 bay leaves 
- 2 thyme sprigs 
- 2 Tbsp. of tomato paste
- 1 bottle red wine
- 2 cans Dr. Pepper
- 3 quarts unsalted beef broth

# Direction 

1. Center a rack in the oven. Preheat oven to 350° F.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy, ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Season ribs all over with salt and pepper. Then, when oil is hot, slip the first section of ribs into the pot and sear 4 to 5 minutes on each side until well browned. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Repeat with remaining ribs.
1. Remove all but 1 Tbsp. of the fat from the pot, reduce the heat to medium and add the vegetables and herbs. Brown the vegetables lightly, 5 to 7 minutes, then stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
1. Add wine, ribs, Dr Pepper and broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, cover tightly and place in the oven to braise for 2½ hours or until the ribs are very tender. Every 30 minutes, skim and discard fat from the surface. When they are finished, remove the ribs and begin to reduce your braising broth to desired consistency.
