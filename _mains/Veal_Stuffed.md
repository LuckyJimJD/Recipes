# Ingredients

- 2 large onions
- 1 medium carrot, grated
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
- 3 slices stale challah, torn into small pieces
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons water
- vegetable oil
- salt and pepper
- Sweet Hungarian paprika
- 3½ to 4 pound breast of veal, with bones

# Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 325.
2. Halve the onions. Finely chop one of those halves for the stuffing. Cut remaining onion into rings and strew over the bottom of a roasting pan.
3. Over low heat, sauté the chopped onion in a tablespoon or so of oil. When soft, add carrot and continue cooking another 5 minutes. Add parsley. Stir and set aside.
4. To make stuffing, sprinkle the water over the challah to moisten it. Combine challah with eggs and sautéed vegetables. Stir well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. To make the pocket in your breast of veal, lay meat flat on your work surface, bones down, the thickest side of the breast facing you. Insert knife horizontally and cut side to side to form pocket, leaving a one-inch margin of meat on each end. Season pocket with salt and pepper. Fill  with stuffing. Sew pocket closed with needle and thread (regular sewing thread works nicely) or secure with wooden skewers.

6. Season meat with salt, pepper and paprika. Rub with vegetable oil. Place in roasting pan, on top of onions, fat side up. Add½ cup water. Cover and cook for 3 hours, or until meat is fork tender. Let cool 15 minutes before slicing.
