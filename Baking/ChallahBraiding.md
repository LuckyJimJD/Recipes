# Four-Strand Braid 

1. Create four equal-size strands. Lay the four strands side-by-side, then pinch them together so they are connected at the top.
2. Take the strand **furthest to the right** and weave it towards the left through the other strands using this pattern: **over, under, over**.
3. Take the strand **furthest to the right** and repeat the weaving pattern again: **over, under, over**. Repeat this pattern, always starting with the strand furthest to the right, until the whole loaf is braided.
4. Pinch the ends of the loose strands together and tuck them under on both ends of the challah loaf to create a nice shape.

# Six-Strand Braid 

1. Take half the dough and form it into 6 balls. 
2. With your hands, roll each ball into a strand about 12 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. 
3. Place the 6 strands in a row, parallel to one another, & pinch the tops of the strands together. 
4. Move the outside right strand over 2 strands. 
5. Then take the second strand from the left and move it to the far right. 
6. Take the outside left strand and move it over 2. 
7. Move second strand from the right over to the far left. Start over with the outside right strand. 
8. Continue this until all strands are braided. For a straight loaf, tuck ends underneath. 
9. For a circular loaf, twist into a circle, pinching ends together. Make a second loaf the same way. 

# Turban Round 

1. Taper the strand at the ends by rolling the dough between your palms.
2. Roll one end of the strand inward to create a spiral snail-shell shape.
3. Continue rolling the strand in the same direction until the spiral is complete. Tuck the loose end of the spiral underneath the challah and pinch it tightly into the bottom, securing it.
