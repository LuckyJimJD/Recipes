# Ingredients

## Dough

- 7 cups (843g) bread or all-purpose flour
- 2 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 2 1/4 cups (510g) water

## Filling

- 1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
- 1 teaspoon poppy seeds
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 3 to 4 grinds fresh black pepper
- 1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil
- Cornmeal for pan

# Directions

## Dough 

- Combine flour, salt, yeast, and onion powder in mixer bowl with beater attachment. 
- Switch to a dough hook, add water and mix until just combined, 1 or 2 minutes at low speed. Cover and let sit for 20 minutes.
- Continue kneading at medium speed for 8 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
- Cover and refrigerate the dough in an oiled bowl overnight.
- Next day, divide the dough into 12 pieces (about 4 ounces each) and shape into balls.
- Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cover with greased plastic, and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour, or until puffy.
- Preheat the oven to 475Â°F.

## Filling 

- Pulse the onion in a food processor until very finely chopped, but not liquid.
- Mix in the poppy seed, salt, and pepper.
- Heat the oil in a saucepan and cook the onion mixture for a few minutes over medium-low heat until the liquid cooks off and the onion is very slightly caramelized.
- Remove from the heat and cool.

## Shape & Bake 

- Lightly sprinkle 2 baking sheets with farina or cornmeal. Take each dough ball and stretch it into a bagel shape about 6" to 7" in diameter, without puncturing the center, and leaving a wide, flat indentation where the hole would be. Place a few inches apart on the prepared baking sheets, 6 per pan. Place a scant teaspoon of the onion filling in the indentation and spread it out with your fingers. _Don't overfill_.
- Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until light golden brown. 
- Remove the bialys from the oven and serve warm; or cool on a rack and save for toasting later.
