# Ingredients

\begin{multicols}{2}

20g ripe sourdough starter (for sour)

152g rye flour (for sour)

114g water (for sour)

128g rye flour

150g bread or all-purpose flour

170g room-temperature water

1 teaspoon active dry yeast

1 1/2 teaspoons salt

\end{multicols}

# Directions

1. **To make the sour:** Mix sourdough starter, 152 grams rye flour, and 114 grams water. Cover and let sit for 14 to 16 hours at room temperature.
2. **To make the dough:** Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix and knead for 3 minutes on first speed, and about 2 minutes on second speed; the dough will be shaggy, and won't look kneaded.
3. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 to 45 minutes; it won't rise significantly.
4. Gently deflate the dough, shape it into a ball, and place it into a stoneware bread-baking bowl, or onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.
5. Cover the loaf and let it rise for 50 to 60 minutes in a warm place.
6. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
7. Uncover the loaf, and slash a cross onto the top, to allow for expansion.
8. Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 425°F, and continue baking for 20 to 30 minutes, until the loaf's surface is golden brown.
9. Remove the bread from the oven and, after 5 minutes, transfer it to a rack to cool completely. The baked bread should rest for 24 hours before slicing, for best quality.
10. Store bread at room temperature, loosely wrapped, for up to 5 days or so; freeze for longer storage.
