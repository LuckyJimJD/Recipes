# Ingredients

## Levain 

- 150 g rye bread flour
- 150 g water
- 20 g rye starter

## Dough 

- 300 g rye levain
- 300 g wheat bread flour
- 170 g water
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 tablespoon caraway seed
- 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 

# Directions

1. Mix rye starter, rye flour, and water in a bowl. Cover and let rise for 12 to 16 hours at room temperature. 

2. Mix levain, water, flour, and salt in stand mixer with a dough hook (4 minutes) or a large wooden spoon (7 minutes). Pour the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface and knead it by hand for a while. Let dough rise in a covered bowl for 1 hour.

3. Place dough on floured surface, press into a rectangle, and fold. Start at the top, fold it to about one-third. Then fold the top-right into the middle. Repeat with the top-left corner, then the bottom-right and bottom-left corners. Then roll from the bottom up with floured palms. Turn over and press the seam closed.

4. Place dough in floured brotform, with the seam facing up. Sprinkle with flour, seal in a plastic bag, and leave to rise for 2 to 3 hours.

5. About 45 minutes before baking, heat oven and reheat it to 480° F. Place a baking sheet on the bottom of the oven and baking dish or stone in the lower third. 

6. Carefully remove the dough from the brotform onto the pre-heated baking dish or stone, place it in the oven, and carefully pour hot water on the baking sheet to create steam.

7. Bake for about 15 minutes, reduce oven temperature to 410° F, and bake for another 20-30 minutes. Remove bread from the oven and let it cool completely on a rack.
