# Ingredients

- 228g sourdough starter, ripe or discard
- 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast (optional)
- 198g lukewarm milk
- 28g packed dark brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon whole anise seeds
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 54g rye flour (light or dark)
- 58g whole wheat flour
- 206-240g all-purpose flour

# Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the starter, yeast (if using), milk, sugar, salt, seeds, and cardamom. Stir in the rye flour and beat until the batter is smooth.
2. Add the whole wheat flour, then the all-purpose flour 1 cup at a time, stirring after each addition until the dough forms a shaggy mass.
3. Knead the dough for 6-7 minutes in stand mixer. The dough should be smooth, elastic, and a little tacky, but not so sticky that it coats your finger. 
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
5. Deflate the dough and place in oiled loaf pan. Cover with greased plastic and let it rise for 45 to 60 minutes, until puffy.
6. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 400°F.
7. Bake the bread for about 25 minutes, or until nicely browned and hollow sounding when thumped on the bottom. Remove it from the oven and cool on a rack.
8. Store bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.
