# Step 1

Create four equal-size strands. Lay the four strands side-by-side, then pinch them together so they are connected at the top.

# Step 2

Take the strand **furthest to the right** and weave it towards the left through the other strands using this pattern: **over, under, over**.

# Step 3

Take the strand **furthest to the right** and repeat the weaving pattern again: **over, under, over**. Repeat this pattern, always starting with the strand furthest to the right, until the whole loaf is braided.

# Step 4

Pinch the ends of the loose strands together and tuck them under on both ends of the challah loaf to create a nice shape.
