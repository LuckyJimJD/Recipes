# Ingredients

\begin{multicols}{2}

75 grams rye sourdough starter

1/4 teaspoon ground coriander

250 grams wheat bread flour

2 teaspoons salt

1/2 liter of water

250 grams rye bread flour

1/2 Tablespoon caraway seed

250 grams wheat flour

\end{multicols}

# Directions

1. Mix the rye leavening, rye bread flour and water. This will create a thinner batter. It’s best to do this in the evening and leave until morning to rise.
2. In the morning, add the wheat flour, wheat bread flour, salt, coriander and caraway seeds. Mix thoroughly for 5 minutes and then let rise for about 3 hours. Then divide the dough into two parts, shaping into long oval loaves.
3. Place loaves in oval brotforms and let rise again for about an hour.
4. While loaves are rising, heat oven to 500° F., with cast iron skillet on bottom of oven and large baking sheet on lower rack. 
5. Place loaves on heated baking sheet, pour 1 cup of water to heated skillet to create steam, and bake for 10 minutes. 
6. Reduce oven temperature to  390° F and bake for another 40-50 minutes.
