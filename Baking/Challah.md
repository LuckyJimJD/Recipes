# Ingredients
##### For 2 loaves
## Dough 

* 1.5 tablespoons active dry yeast 
* 398 grams lukewarm water 
* 180 grams + 1 tblsp sugar 
* ½ cup vegetable oil 
* 4 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 900 grams all-purpose flour

## Topping 
* 1 egg
* Poppy and/or sesame seeds

# Directions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 398 grams lukewarm water.
2. Whisk oil into yeast, then beat in 4 eggs, one at a time, with remaining sugar and salt. Gradually add flour. When dough holds together, it is ready for kneading. (You can also use a mixer with a dough hook for both mixing and kneading.)
3. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Clean out bowl and grease it, then return dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until almost doubled in size. 
4. Punch down dough, cover and let rise again in a warm place for another half-hour.
5. Divide dough & braid. Place loaves on lined baking sheet, and let rise for another hour. 
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
7. Brush loaves with egg wash and sprinkle with seeds.
8. Bake in middle of oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden. 
9. Place on rack to cool. 

### Note

Loaves may be frozen after braiding. Remove from freezer 5 hours before baking.

# Brading Challah 

## Four-Strand Braid 

1. Create four equal-size strands. Lay strands side-by-side & pinch together at one end.
2. Take the strand **furthest to the right** and weave it towards the left through the other strands, going **over, under, over**.
3. Take the strand **furthest to the right** and repeat the weaving pattern again: **over, under, over**. Repeat this pattern, always starting with the strand furthest to the right, until the whole loaf is braided.
4. Pinch the ends of the loose strands together and tuck them under.

## Six-Strand Braid 

1. Divide dough into 6 balls & roll into strands, about 12 inches long & 1.5 inches wide. 
2. Place strands in a row, parallel to one another, & pinch together at one end. 
3. Move the outside right strand over 2 strands. 
4. Then take the second strand from the left and move it to the far right. 
5. Take the outside left strand and move it over 2. 
6. Move second strand from the right over to the far left. Start over with the outside right strand. 
7. Continue this until all strands are braided, then pinch ends together and tuck them under.
8. For a circular loaf, twist into a circle, pinching ends together. 

## Turban Round 

1. Roll dough into one strand & taper at the ends by rolling the dough between your palms.
2. Roll one end of the strand inward to create a spiral snail-shell shape.
3. Continue rolling the strand in the same direction until the spiral is complete. 
4. Tuck the loose end of the spiral underneath the challah and pinch it tightly into the bottom, securing it.
