# Kaiser Rolls 

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 3 cups (361g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup (170g) lukewarm water

### Topping

- 1 tablespoon (14g) milk
- 2 tablespoons (18g) poppy or sesame seeds

## Directions 

1. Mix, then knead together all of the dough ingredients — by hand, stand mixer, or in the bucket of a bread machine programmed for the dough cycle — to make a smooth, supple dough.
2. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise until noticeably puffy, about 1 hour.
3. Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. Divide the dough into six equal pieces. Shape the pieces into round balls, and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
4. Center a kaiser stamp over one ball of dough. Press down firmly, cutting nearly to the bottom but not all the way through. Repeat with the remaining rolls. If you don't have a kaiser roll stamp see an alternate shaping option in "tips," below.
5. Place the rolls cut-side down (this helps them retain their shape) onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover the rolls, and allow them to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they've almost doubled in volume. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F.
6. Turn the rolls cut-side up. Dip their tops in milk, and coat with poppy or sesame seeds, if desired.
7. Bake the rolls for 15 to 17 minutes, or until they're golden brown and feel light to the touch. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack.
8. Serve rolls warm, or at room temperature. Store leftover rolls, well wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days; freeze for longer storage.

# Sourdough Kaiser Rolls 

## Ingredients 

- 210 grams water 
- 280 grams active sourdough starter 
- 2 large eggs 
- 2 tablespoons light olive oil 
- 670 grams bread flour 
- 28 grams malt extract 
- 2 tsp salt 
- 2 tablespoons sugar 

## Directions 

1. Mix ingredients until they come together. Knead for 5 minutes, cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Knead for another 5 minutes, then cover and let rise until it has doubled in size.
2. Once the dough is developed, divide into 12 pieces. On a clean, dry surface, place dough ball between thumb and little finger (without other fingers touching) and roll across the work surface so the dough is pushed under as it moves. Cover rolls and let relax about 20 minutes. 
3. Dip kaiser roll stamp in rye flour and press down on roll. Cuts should be deep, but be careful not to cut all the way through. 
4. Press the cut side of the rolls into a dish of sesame seeds or poppy seeds.
9. Put the rolls, cut side down, onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, or let rise one hour then refrigerate overnight. 
5. Heat oven to 425 F. Turn rolls over so they are cut side up. Place rolls in oven and pour 1/2 cup boiling water into pan placed on bottom of oven to create steam. 
6. Bake for 15 minutes, turning the rolls half way through the bake. Immediately put the rolls on a cooling rack.
