# Sourdough Starter

## Feeding Starter

- To 4 ounces (113 grams) of ripe starter, add 4 ounces (113 grams) each of all-purpose or bread flour and room-temperature water.
  - To increase acidity (for a more sour flavor), feed with whole wheat flour or a mix of rye & all-purpose or bread flour. 
  - If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can measure by volume: about 1 cup each of starter & flour, and 1/2 cup of water. 
  - Discarded ripe starter can be used for pancakes, etc. 
- Mix until smooth and cover. 
- Let sit at room temperature for about 2 hours (until it starts to bubble) before refrigerating. 
  - Feed refrigerated starter at least once weekly. 

## Using Refrigerated Starter 

- Feed refrigerated starter, adding equal amounts (by weight) of flour and water to existing starter.
- Let fed starter sit at room temperature until volume has doubled (about 6-8 hours).
  - You might need to repeat the feeding process another time for the starter to become active after being refrigerated. 
- Once fed starter has doubled in volume, remove the amount needed for your recipe, and feed the remainder as above for refrigeration. 

## Reviving Neglected Starter  

- If a clear liquid and/or a grey/brown skin develops on top of the starter, this means it's gone too long without feeding. 
  - Skim off any skin and discard. 
  - Stir the liquid into the starter. 
  - Feed and leave at room temperature, repeating every 12 hours about two or three times until it becomes active and bubbly.
