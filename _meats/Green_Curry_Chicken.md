# Ingredients

## Green Curry Paste

- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 stalk lemongrass (minced)
- 1 ounce ginger (grated)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 cup  fresh cilantro (leaves and stems, chopped, loose cup)
- 1/2 tsp white pepper
- 4 tablespoons shallot (or 1/4 cup purple onion, diced)
- 1 to 1 1/2 green chile (sliced, divided)
- 1 tsp shrimp paste (or 1 extra tablespoon fish sauce)
- 2 1/2 tsps fish sauce
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp lime juice (freshly squeezed)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 can coconut milk

## Chicken Curry

- 2 tsp peanut oil
- 3/4 can coconut milk
- 1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs, cut into chunks
- 1 handful green beans
- 1 red or green bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks
- 4 makrut lime leaves (or 1 tsp grated lime zest)
- 1 handful fresh Thai basil 
- Jasmine rice

# Directions

1. Place all of the ingredients for the curry paste in a food processor. Process until all ingredients are blended and have a smooth consistency. 
2. Warm a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the peanut oil and swirl around. Add the green curry paste. Saut√© briefly to release the fragrance, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
3. Reserve 4 tablespoons of coconut milk. Add the remaining coconut milk to the wok.
4. Add the chicken, stirring to incorporate. When the curry sauce comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir occasionally.
5. While the chicken cooks, prepare the makrut lime leaves by tearing the leaf away from either side of the stem, discarding the central stem. Using scissors, cut the leaves into thin strips. Reserve.
6. Add the green beans and peppers, plus the strips of lime leaves (or lime zest). Stir well to incorporate. Simmer until vegetables are cooked to your liking. Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly.
7. Add the Thai basil to the pan and stir.
8. Portion the curry in 4 bowls, and top with fresh basil and 1 tablespoon per bowl of the reserved coconut milk. Serve with Thai jasmine rice on the side.
