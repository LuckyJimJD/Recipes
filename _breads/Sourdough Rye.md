# Ingredients

- 20g ripe sourdough starter (for sour)
- 152g rye flour (for sour)
- 114g water (for sour)
- 128g rye flour
- 150g bread or all-purpose flour
- 170g room-temperature water
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1½ teaspoons salt


# Directions

## Sour 

1. Mix sourdough starter, 152 grams rye flour, and 114 grams water. 
2. Cover and let sit for 14 to 16 hours at room temperature.

## Dough 

1. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix and knead for 3 minutes on first speed, and about 2 minutes on second speed; the dough will be shaggy, and won't look kneaded.
2. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 to 45 minutes; it won't rise significantly.
3. Gently deflate the dough, shape it into a ball, and place it into a stoneware bread-baking bowl, or onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.
4. Cover the loaf and let it rise for 50 to 60 minutes in a warm place.

## Baking 

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
2. Uncover the loaf, and slash a cross onto the top, to allow for expansion.
3. Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 425°F, and continue baking for 20 to 30 minutes, until the loaf's surface is golden brown.
4. Remove the bread from the oven and, after 5 minutes, transfer it to a rack to cool completely. The baked bread should rest for 24 hours before slicing, for best quality.
5. Store bread at room temperature, loosely wrapped, for up to 5 days or so; freeze for longer storage.
