# Ingredients

* 1 tblsp instant dry yeast
* 113g (½ cup) lukewarm water 
* 70g (⅓ cup) vegetable oil 
* 85g (¼ cup) honey (or 50g/¼ cup sugar)
* 2 large eggs, plus one for egg wash
* 1½ tsp salt
* 482g (4 cups) all-purpose flour
* Poppy and/or sesame seeds

# Directions

1. Whisk together yeast, sugar, & 100g of lukewarm water in a mixing bowl. Let stand for about 10 minutes. 
2. In another bowl, whisk together flour and salt. 
3. When yeast mixture begins to bubble, add the oil, whisk in eggs one at a time, then pour into bowl with flour and stir to combine in a shaggy mass. 
4. Knead dough (3-4 minutes in stand mixer on speed 2 or by hand), adding more water little by little as needed, until dough is soft & smooth. 
5. Place dough in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or warm damp cloth, and let rise for 1 hour, until almost doubled in bulk. Gently deflate then return to covered bowl to rise for another 30 minutes. 
6. Remove dough to lightly-floured surface and divide into pieces (3, 4, or 6 as desired for braiding). Roll pieces into strands, about 12 inches long, and let rest for about 10 minutes. 
7. Braid the loaf and place on a silicon or parchment lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until puffy, about 1 hour at room temperature (or a few hours in refrigerator for more developed flavor). 
8. Toward the end of the rising time, heat oven to 375° F.
9. Beat egg with a little water and brush on the risen loaf, then sprinkle with seeds. 
10. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until crust is golden brown. Cover with a loose tent of aluminum foil and continue baking until internal temperature reaches 190° F (about 10-15 minutes).
