# Ingredients

* 1 tblsp instant dry yeast
* 113g (½ cup) lukewarm water 
* 70g (⅓ cup) vegetable oil 
* 85g (¼ cup) honey (or 50g/¼ cup sugar)
* 2 large eggs, plus one for egg wash
* 1½ tsp salt
* 482g (4 cups) all-purpose flour
* Poppy and/or sesame seeds

# Directions

1. Whisk flour and salt together in mixing bowl. 
2. In another bowl, dissolve yeast in water, add the oil, then whisk in eggs one at a time. 
3. Pour liquid ingredients into bowl with flour and stir to combine. 
4. Knead in stand mixer (3-4 minutes on speed 2) or by hand until dough is soft & smooth. 
5. Place dough in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or warm damp cloth, and let rise for 1 hour, until almost doubled in bulk. Gently deflate then return to covered bowl to rise for another 30 minutes. 
6. Remove dough to lightly-floured surface and divide into pieces (3, 4, or 6 as desired for braiding). Roll pieces into strands, about 12 inches long, and let rest for about 10 minutes. 
7. Braid the loaf and place on a silicon or parchment lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until puffy, about 1 hour at room temperature (or a few hours in refrigerator for more developed flavor). 
8. Toward the end of the rising time, heat oven to 375° F.
9. Beat egg with a little water and brush on the risen loaf, then sprinkle with seeds. 
10. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until crust is golden brown. Cover with a loose tent of aluminum foil and continue baking until internal temperature reaches 190° F (about 10-15 minutes).
