# Ingredients 

## Overnight Starter

- 85g (¾ cup) all-purpose flour
- 113g (½ cup) lukewarm water
- ⅛ tsp instant yeast

## Dough

- all of the starter
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 152g (⅓ cup) lukewarm water
- 326g (2¾ cups) all-purpose flour
- 1¼ tsp salt

## Glaze

- 1 large egg white, beaten with 1 tblsp water

# Directions

## Starter 

1. Mix the starter ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Cover and let rest at room temperature overnight.

## Rolls 

1. Combine the starter with remaining dough ingredients. Mix and knead by hand, or using a stand mixer, to make a smooth dough. It won't be particularly soft nor stiff; it should be smooth and feel bouncy and elastic under your hands.
2. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let it rise at room temperature for 45 minutes. 
3. Gently deflate dough and let it rise another 45 minutes, until it's very puffy.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide it into six pieces.
5. Roll the pieces into cylinders, 4½" in length. Flatten the cylinders slightly; dough rises more in the center, so this will give a gently rounded top versus a high top.
6. Place the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. While they're rising, preheat oven to 425°F.
7. Brush the rolls with the egg white mixture. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190°F.
8. Remove the rolls from the oven and transfer them to a rack to cool.
