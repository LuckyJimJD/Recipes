# Ingredients 

- 482g (4 cups) all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp kosher salt or 1½ tsp table salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2¼ tsp active dry or instant yeast
- 2 cups (454g) lukewarm water
- softened unsalted butter, for greasing

# Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. Add the water and mix until the water is absorbed and the dough comes together in a sticky ball.
2. Cover the bowl and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1½ hours, until the dough has doubled in bulk.
3. Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat it to 425°F. 
4. Use the butter to generously grease two 1-quart oven-safe bowls or a 3-quart casserole dish (for one large loaf).
5. Use two forks to deflate the dough by releasing it from the side of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. 
6. To make a single large loaf, pick up the mixing bowl, turn it over, and plop the dough into the larger casserole dish.
7. Let dough rise, uncovered, in a warm spot for 10 to 20 minutes, until almost doubled.
8. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375°F and bake 25 to 30 minutes more. 
9. When the bread is golden brown all over, remove from the oven and turn the bread out onto a cooling rack.
