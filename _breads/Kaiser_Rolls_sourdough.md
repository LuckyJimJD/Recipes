---

# Ingredients 

- 210 grams water 
- 280 grams active sourdough starter 
- 2 large eggs 
- 2 tablespoons light olive oil 
- 670 grams bread flour 
- 28 grams malt extract 
- 2 tsp salt 
- 2 tablespoons sugar 

# Directions 

1. Mix ingredients until they come together. Knead for 5 minutes, cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Knead for another 5 minutes, then cover and let rise until it has doubled in size.
2. Once the dough is developed, divide into 12 pieces. On a clean, dry surface, place dough ball between thumb and little finger (without other fingers touching) and roll across the work surface so the dough is pushed under as it moves. Cover rolls and let relax about 20 minutes. 
3. Dip kaiser roll stamp in rye flour and press down on roll. Cuts should be deep, but be careful not to cut all the way through. 
4. Press the cut side of the rolls into a dish of sesame seeds or poppy seeds.
9. Put the rolls, cut side down, onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, or let rise one hour then refrigerate overnight. 
5. Heat oven to 425 F. Turn rolls over so they are cut side up. Place rolls in oven and pourÂ½ cup boiling water into pan placed on bottom of oven to create steam. 
6. Bake for 15 minutes, turning the rolls half way through the bake. Immediately put the rolls on a cooling rack.
