# Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast
- 7/8 to 1 1/8 cups (198g to 255g) lukewarm water 
- 2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil
- 3 cups (361g) all-purpose flour
- 1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) salt

# Directions

1. Combine yeast with remaining ingredients. Mix and knead everything together (4-5 minutes on speed 2) until it forms a smooth dough. Don't over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface.
	- If using active dry yeast, dissolve it in 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar. Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. Then combine with other ingredients, mix, & knead as above. 
	- Use more water in cold/dry conditions, less in hot/humid conditions. 
2. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it's very puffy. This will take about an hour using instant yeast, or 90 minutes using active dry.
	- _To make pizza later:_ Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours (or for up to 24 hours); it will rise slowly as it chills and will develop the crust's flavor. Remove dough from refrigerate about 2 to 3 hours before you want to serve pizza.
3. Divide dough in half for two pizzas, or leave whole for one pizza. Recipe will make: 
	- Two 1/2"-thick 14" round pizzas;
	- Two 3/4"-thick 12" round pizzas;
	- One 3/4" to 1"-thick 13" x 18" rectangular (Sicilian-style) pizza;
	- One 1 1/2"-thick 9" x 13" rectangular pizza;
	- One 1"-thick 14" round pizza.
4. Shape dough for type of pizza (oval for rectangular pizza; circle for round pizza). Stretch dough briefly into shape, but do not pat it flat. 
5. Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes.
6. Lightly grease pan(s) with vegetable oil spray, then drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the pan(s). The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust flavor and crunch.
7. Place dough in prepared pan(s). Press it over the bottom of the pan, stretching it towards the edges. When dough starts shrinking back, let it rest about 15 minutes, covered with plastic wrap. Then stretch to edges of pan. Let it rest and stretch again if necessary. 
8. Cover dough and allow dough to rise until it's noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes (or 2 to 2 1/2 hours if it's been refrigerated). Towards the end of the rising time, heat the oven to 450° F.
9. Bake pizza crust on the lower oven rack until it looks and feels set on top, and is just beginning to brown around the edge of the crust, but is still pale on top. This will take about 8 minutes for thinner crust pizza; about 10 to 12 minutes for medium thickness; and 12 to 14 minutes for thick-crust pizza. If baking two pizzas, reverse them in the oven (top to bottom, bottom to top) midway through the baking period.
10. Remove pizza from the oven and add toppings. Return to the oven and bake on the upper oven rack for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, both top and bottom, and the cheese is melted. Check it midway through, and move it to the bottom rack if the top is browning too much, or the bottom not enough.
	- _To serve pizza up to 2 days later:_ Remove the partially baked crust from the oven, cool completely on a rack, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature. When ready to serve, top and bake in a preheated 450°F oven, adding a couple of minutes to the baking times noted above. 
14. Remove pizza from the oven, transfer it to a rack, and let it cool slightly before serving.
