# Ingredients

- Water
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- ½ tsp sugar
- 3 cups all-purpose flour (or 1 ½ cups each all-purpose & whole wheat flour)
- 1 to 2 tsp kosher salt
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 

# Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl add 1 cup lukewarm water and stir in yeast and sugar until dissolved. Add ½ cup flour and whisk together. Place the mixing bowl in a warm place, uncovered to form a lose sponge. Give it 15 minutes or so, the mixture should bubble.
2. Add salt, olive oil and almost all the remaining flour (keep about ½ cup of the flour for dusting later). Stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass. Dust with a little flour, then knead the mixture inside the bowl for about a minute to incorporate any stray bits.
3. Dust a clean working surface with just a little bit of flour. Knead lightly for a couple minutes or so until smooth. Cover and let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then knead again for a couple more minutes. The dough should be a little bit moist, you can help it with a little dusting of flour, but be careful not to add too much flour.
4. Clean the mixing bowl and coat it lightly with extra virgin olive oil and put the dough back in the bowl. Turn the dough a couple times in the bowl to coat with the olive oil. Cover the mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap then lay a kitchen towel over. Put the bowl in a warm place. Leave it alone for 1 hour or until the dough rises to double its size.
5. Deflate the dough and place it on a clean work surface. Divide the dough into 7 to 8 equal pieces and shape them into balls. Cover with a towel and leave them for 10 minutes or so to rest.
6. Using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces into a circle that's 8-9 inches wide and about a quarter inch thick. It helps to lift and turn the dough frequently as you roll so that dough doesn't stick to your counter too much. (If dough starts to stick, sprinkle a tiny bit of flour). If the dough starts to spring back, set it aside to rest for a few minutes, then continue rolling. Repeat with the other pieces of dough. (Once you get going, you can be cooking one pita while rolling another, if you like). You have two options for baking the pita from here.
7. _To bake in the oven_. 
	- Heat the oven to 475° F and place a heavy-duty baking pan or large cast iron skillet on the middle rack to heat. 
	- Working in batches, place the rolled-out pitas directly on the hot baking baking sheet. 
	- Bake for 2 minutes on one side, then turn over with tongs and bake for 1 minute on the other side.  
	- The pita is ready when it puffs up. 
	- Remove from the oven and cover the baked pitas with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the pitas.
8. _To bake on stovetop_. 
	- Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil and wipe off any excess. 
	- Working with one pita at a time, lay a rolled-out pita on the skillet and bake for 30 seconds, until bubbles start to form. Then flip over with a spatula and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side, until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Flip once more and cook another 1-2 minutes to toast the first side. 
	- The pita is ready when it puffs up forming a pocket (sometimes, with this method, the pita may not puff or may only form a small pocket). 
	- Keep baked pita covered with a clean towel while you work on the rest.
