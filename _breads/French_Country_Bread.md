# Ingredients 

## Starter

- 228g (1 cup) cool to lukewarm water (90°F to 100°F)
- ½ tsp active dry or instant yeast
- 150g (1¼ cups) bread flour 
- 28g (¼ cup) whole wheat flour

## Dough

- all of the starter (above)
- 1 cup (227g) lukewarm water (100°F to 115°F)
- ¾ tsp active dry or 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 tblsp sugar
- 450g to 480g (3¾ to 4 cups) bread flour
- 1½ to 2¼ tsp salt, to taste

# Directions

## Starter

1. Stir all of the starter ingredients together to make a thick, pudding-like mixture. 
2. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 2 hours or up to 16 hours. 

## Bread 

1. Stir down the starter with a spoon and add the water, yeast, sugar, 390g of the flour, and the salt. The dough will be a loose, messy mass. 
2. Let it rest for 12 to 15 minutes, then stir it again; it should become more cohesive and a bit smoother. 
3. Knead the dough (adding up to an additional 90g flour, as needed to make a soft dough), 10 to 12 minutes.
4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or plastic container, cover with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until almost doubled (1 to 2 hours). 
5. Deflate the dough gently, but don't knock out all the air; this will create the holes so important to French bread. 
6. Form the dough into one large or two smaller balls.
7. Place a semolina- or cornmeal-dusted piece of parchment paper onto a baking sheet. Gently place the ball(s) of dough on the baking sheet, seam-side down.
8. Cover the bread gently with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's puffy and about 40% to 50% larger, anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes.
9. Preheat oven to 475°F.
10. Slash or cross-hatch the bread with a sharp knife or lame. Dust it with a little flour. Spritz water into the oven with a clean plant mister, and place the bread in the oven. Reduce the heat to 425°F and spritz with water every few minutes for the first 15 minutes of baking.
11. Bake the bread for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until it's a rich golden brown, and its interior temperature registers at least 190°F on a digital thermometer. 
12. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack.
