# Ingredients 

## For the Rye Leaven

- 170g wholemeal rye flour (finely ground)
- 170g water
- 30g rye starter

## For the Dough

- 360g wholemeal rye flour (finely ground)
- 340g rye leaven (save remainder as starter)
- 320g water
- 50g whole cereal grains (wheat, spelt)
- 50g flakes (oat, rye)
- 50g sunflower seeds
- 30g dark rye malt
- 15g of salt
- Butter for greasing the loaf pan

# Directions

1. _Prepare the leaven:_ Mix rye starter, rye flour and water. Cover and leave to rise at room temperature for 12-16 hours.

2. In a saucepan, cover cereal grains with water over them and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain in a colander.

3. To 340g of the rye leaven, add water, flour, cooled cooked cereal grain, oat or rye flakes, seeds, malt and salt. Mix the dough to combine the ingredients. Do not overmix.

4. Grease a loaf pan with butter. Then gradually transfer all the dough from the bowl into the pan. Smooth the dough with a damp palm or spatula and compact it nicely. The dough should reach about 2 cm below the edge. Sprinkle with seeds, flakes or coarse semolina. Cover and leave to rise for 2 to 3 hours.

5. The leavened dough will increase in volume and you will see cracks on the surface. About half an hour before the end of leavening, preheat the oven to 250° C. Put the loaf pan in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 220° C and continue baking for another 35 minutes. Then carefully take the bread out of the loaf pan and let it bake for another 10 to 15 minutes. The bread is ready when it reaches an internal temperature of 97° C.

6. Place the finished bread on a rack and let it cool completely. Give it a few hours and don't be impatient. The bread will sit well, will not stick to the knife and will be easier to cut. Enjoy!
