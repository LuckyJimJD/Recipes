# Ingredients 

## For the Rye Leaven

- 170g wholemeal rye flour (finely ground)
- 170g water
- 30g rye starter

## For the Dough

- 360g wholemeal rye flour (finely ground)
- 340g rye leaven (save remainder as starter)
- 320g water
- 50g whole cereal grains (wheat, spelt)
- 50g flakes (oat, rye)
- 50g sunflower seeds
- 30g dark rye malt
- 15g of salt
- butter to smear the mold

# Directions

1. _Prepare the leaven:_ Mix rye starter, rye flour and water. Cover and leave to rise at room temperature for 12-16 hours.

2. In a saucepan, cover cereal grains with water over them and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain in a colander.

3. To 340g of the rye leaven, add water, flour, cooled cooked cereal grain, oat or rye flakes, seeds, malt and salt. Mix the dough to combine the ingredients. Do not mix for an unnecessarily long time - it is enough if everything is nicely mixed.

4. Wipe the bread pan with butter. Then gradually transfer all the dough from the bowl into it. Straighten the dough with a damp palm or spatula and compact it nicely. The dough should reach about 2 cm below the edge. Sprinkle with seeds, flakes or coarse semolina. Cover and leave to rise for 2 to 3 hours.

5. The leavened dough will increase in volume and you will see cracks on the surface. About half an hour before the end of leavening, preheat the oven to 250 ° C. Put the dough mold in it and bake for 10 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 220 ° C and continue baking for a total baking time of 45 minutes. Then carefully take out the bread in the mold and let the loaf itself bake freely for another 10 to 15 minutes. The bread is ready when it reaches an internal temperature of 97 ° C on Wednesday.

6. Attention, the most important thing now! Place the baked bread on the grid and let it cool completely. Feel free to give it a few hours and don't be impatient. The bread will sit well, will not stick to the cut and will be easier to cut. Enjoy!
