- 20g rye sourdough starter (žitného kvasu)

## For the Dough (těsto)

# Directions

## Leaven 

1. Mix the rye starter, rye flour and water. 
2. Cover and let rise overnight (12-16 hours) at room termperature.

1. Mix leaven, water, flour, salt, and caraway seeds in stand mixer with a dough hook (4 minutes). Pour the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface and knead it by hand briefly. 
2. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour.
3. Place dough on floured surface, press into a rectangle, and fold: 
	- Starting at the top, fold it to about one-third. 
	- Fold each corner into the middle. 
	- Roll from the bottom with floured hands and pinch the seam closed. 
4. Place dough in floured brotform, with the seam facing up. Sprinkle with flour, seal in a plastic bag, and leave to rise for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or 12 hours in regrigerator.
5. About 45 minutes before baking, heat oven and reheat it to 480° F. Place cloche or baking stone on rack in lower-third of the oven. If not using a cloche, place a baking sheet or cast iron pan on the bottom of the oven. 
6. Remove the dough from the brotform and slash the top, and place onto the pre-heated baking dish or stone in the oven. If not using a cloche, pour 1 cup of hot water on the baking sheet to create steam.
7. Bake for about 15 minutes (covered, if using a cloche). 
8. Reduce oven temperature to 410° F, and bake for another 20-30 minutes until done. Internal temperature should be about 205° F.
