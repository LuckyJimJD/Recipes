# Ingredients

## **Naan**

- 2 cups (227g) King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour
- 1 1/2 cups (177g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons (28g) butter or ghee (clarified butter), melted
- 1/2 cup (113g) milk or whey (from the drained yogurt, below)
- 3/4 cup (170g) plain whole-milk yogurt
- 1 large egg
- [garlic oil](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/boyajian-garlic-oil-127-oz)Â or olive oil, for brushing on cooked naan

## **Cucumber raita**

- 1 1/2 cups (about 170g) finely diced or grated, peeled, seeded cucumbers (about 2 medium-small cucumbers, or 1 medium-large)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups whole-milk yogurt, drained in a yogurt cheese maker or cheesecloth for several hours
- 1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh mint or cilantro, plus extra for garnish
- 2 to 3 teaspoons minced hot chilies or chili paste, or 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, all optional

# Directions

## Naan

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl and mix until cohesive; the dough will be rough and shaggy.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it until it's smooth and shiny. Or knead for about 7 minutes in a stand mixer.
3. Put the dough into a greased bowl, cover, and set it aside to rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until it's doubled in bulk. At this point, the dough may be refrigerated, covered, for up to 24 hours, for extra flavor and ease of rolling.
4. Divide the dough into six pieces. Hand-stretch or roll each piece into a thin oval shape, about 4" x 7". Pull on the front edge of the oval to elongate and create the traditional tear shape.
5. Let the pieces rest, uncovered, while you heat a griddle on high heat. During the hot days of summer, try heating a cast-iron pan on your outdoor barbecue grill; works like a charm!
6. Transfer the naan to the griddle, as many as will fit at a time. Grill for approximately 2 to 3 minutes on one side, until the bread puffs and begins to look set around the edges. If it appears to be browning too quickly, lower the heat.
7. Flip over and continue to cook, until the bottom side is brown. Remove from the griddle, and brush with olive oil or garlic oil.
8. Serve warm, with raita.

## Raita

1. Place the minced or grated cucumbers in a strainer, and sprinkle with the salt. Let the cucumbers drain for several hours, stirring occasionally. Discard the liquid.
2. Mix the cucumbers with the drained yogurt and the remaining ingredients. Refrigerate, covered, for a few hours, for the flavors to meld. Garnish with fresh mint or cilantro. Refrigerate any leftovers; see storage hint in "tips," at left.
