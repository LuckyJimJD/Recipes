# Ingredients

## **Starter**

- 1 1/2 cups (152g) rye flour
- 1/2 cup (113g) water
- 2 tablespoons (about 21g) ripe (fed) sourdough starter

## **Dough**

- 1 1/4 cups (128g) rye flour
- 1 1/4 cups (149g) bread or all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup (170g) room-temperature water
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (7.4g) salt

# Directions

1. **To make the starter:** Mix all of the ingredients together in the bowl of an electric mixer. Cover and let sit for 14 to 16 hours at room temperature.
2. **To make the dough:** Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix and knead for 3 minutes on first speed, and about 2 minutes on second speed; the dough will be shaggy, and won't look kneaded.
3. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 to 45 minutes; it won't rise significantly.
4. Gently deflate the dough, shape it into a ball, and place it into a stoneware bread-baking bowl, or onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.
5. Cover the loaf and let it rise for 50 to 60 minutes in a warm place.
6. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
7. Uncover the loaf, and slash a cross onto the top, to allow for expansion.
8. Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 425°F, and continue baking for 20 to 30 minutes, until the loaf's surface is golden brown.
9. Remove the bread from the oven and, after 5 minutes, transfer it to a rack to cool completely. The baked bread should rest for 24 hours before slicing, for best quality.
10. Store bread at room temperature, loosely wrapped, for up to 5 days or so; freeze for longer storage.
