# Ingredients

## **Bread**

- 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 standard 1/4-ounce packet) active dry yeast
- 1/3 cup (79 ml) plus 1 teaspoon honey
- 1/3 cup (79 ml) neutral oil, plus more for the bowl
- 2 large eggs plus 1 large yolk
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (8 grams) table salt
- 4 1/4 cups all-purpose (530 grams) or bread flour (578 grams), plus more for your work surface

## F**illing**

- 2 medium baking apples (I love baking with MacIntoshes), peeled, cored and in 1/2- to 3/4-inch chunks
- Squeeze of lemon juice, to keep them from browning

## **Egg wash**

- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Poppy seeds

# **Directions**

## Preparing the dough

1. Whisk yeast and 1 teaspoon honey into 2/3 cup warm water and let stand until foamy, a few minutes.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixture, whisk together yeast mixture, oil, remaining honey (1/3 cup), eggs and yolk. Switch to dough hook and add 4 1/4 cups flour and salt. Use dough hook on a moderate speed until it pulls all of the flour and wet ingredients together into a craggy mass. Lower the speed and let the dough hook knead the dough for 5 minutes, until smooth, elastic and a little sticky.
3. Transfer dough to large oil-coated bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour, or until   almost doubled in size.

## Adding the filling

1. Turn dough out onto a floured counter and gently press it down into a flat, oblong shape. The shape does  matter so however it goes, it goes.

2. Spread 2/3 of apple chunks over 1/2 of the flattened dough.
3. Fold the other half over the apple chunks and press the dough down around them, flattening the now lumpy dough.
4. Spread the remaining 1/3 apple chunks over half the folded dough.
5. Fold the other half over the apples, pressing the dough down again, making a square packet.
6. Fold the corners under with the sides of your hands and form the dough into a round.
7. Upend your empty bowl over and set it aside for another 30-60 minutes.

## Weaving (see photos below)

1. Remove dough from bowl & punch down to remove air pockets.
2. Divide dough into 4 pieces. 
3. Roll and stretch into strands, about 12 inches long.
4. Arrange two strands in each direction, perpendicular to each other, like a plus sign. Weave them so that one side is over, and the other is under, where they meet. 
5. Take the four legs that come from  the center and move them over the leg to their right, i.e. jumping it.
6. Take those legs that were on the right and again, jump each over the leg before, this time to the left.
7. Repeat left-right jumps as needed.
8. Tuck corners under dough with sides of your hands to form a round loaf.
9. Transfer the dough to a parchment-covered heavy baking sheet and let rise for another hour.
