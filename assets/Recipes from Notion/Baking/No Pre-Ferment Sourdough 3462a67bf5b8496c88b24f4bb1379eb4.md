# Ingredients

- 750g all-purpose flour
- 250g rye or whole wheat flour
- 750g water (65째F in hot weather, 90째F in cold weather )
- 20g salt
- 100g sourdough starter (unfed/discard). Use less starter (40-50g) in hot weather.

# Directions

1. Mix all ingredients in bowl by hand until the dough forms a shaggy mass and the flour is hydrated.
2. Cover and let rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. 
3. Fold by pulling the sides of the dough up with a wet hand, then pressing to the middle to seal. Repeat this on all four sides.
4. Cover and let rest again for 15 minutes. 
5. Repeat folding & resting two more times.
6. Cover tightly and let rest at room temperature overnight (about 12 hours). 
7. Divide dough in half and shape into rounds. Cover and let rest, seam-side down, for 10 minutes. 
8. Place loaves in flour-lined bannetons & cover. 
9. If dough doubled overnight, place in refrigerator for 8-12 hours. If dough increased by less than double, let rest at room temperature for 30-60 minutes first. 
10. Preheat two Dutch ovens in 500째F oven for 45 minutes. 
11. Invert loaves onto a sheet of parchment, score with a lame, and carefully place the dough in the preheated Dutch ovens. Replace the lids and return to the oven.
12. Reduce the oven temperature to 450째F and bake for 20 minutes with the lids in place.
13. After 20 minutes, remove the lids and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes, or until the loaves have deep color.
