# Ingredients

## **Pâte Fermentée**

- ½ cup plus 1 teaspoon (120 g) lukewarm water
- ⅔ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1⅓ cups plus 1 tablespoon (180 g) bread flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## **Dough**

- 1⅓ cups (320 g) lukewarm water
- 3½ cups plus 2 tablespoons (465 g) bread flour
- ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons (150 g) (risen and deflated) pâte fermentée, cut into walnut-size pieces
- ¾ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt

## **Filling**

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 6 cups (900 g) yellow onions, finely diced
- ½ cup (60 g) fine dried bread crumbs
- 1½ tablespoons poppy seeds
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

# Directions

## **Pâte Fermentée**

*Makes about 1 1/4 cups* 

1. Put the water and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, then add the flour and salt. 
2. Mix on low speed for 2 minutes until combined into a shaggy dough. 
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Refrigerate the mixture for a minimum of 8 hours and a maximum of 24. (There is no need to return it to room temperature before using.)

## Bialys

### Dough

1. Put the water and flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, and mix for 2 minutes. Let rest for 20 minutes.
2. Add the pâte fermentée, yeast, and salt and mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are completely combined. Add a little more water if this hasn’t happened in 3 minutes. Increase the speed to medium to medium-high and mix until the dough is smooth, pulls away from the sides of the bowl (and leaves the sides clean), has a bit of shine, and makes a slapping noise against the sides of the bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. Do the windowpane test (see note below) to check to see if the gluten is fully developed
3. Dust a clean bowl lightly with flour and transfer the dough to it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or put the whole bowl in a large plastic bag) and let stand at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (each weighingabout 2¾ ounces/80 g). Form each piece into a small bun, cover with plastic wrap,and let rest for 5 minutes. Proceeding in the same order in which you shaped the pieces into balls, flatten each ball with the heel of your hand into a disk about 4 inches/10 cm in diameter.
5. Dip the bialys in cornmeal and place them an inch apart on baking sheets lines with parchment. Loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let stand until the rolls are very soft and hold an indentation when you touch them lightly, 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes.
6. Put a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 500°F. Let the stone heat up for at least 30 minutes.

### Filling

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring now and then, until they just begin to brown and have reduced to about a third of their original volume, about 20 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl and stir in the bread crumbs,poppy seeds and salt. Set aside to cool.
2. Uncover the bialys and, using the pads of both your index and middle fingertips, make a depression in the center of each disk of dough. Put about 2 tablespoons filling in the center of each bialy, spreading it out so it fills the center.

### Baking

1. In one swift motion, slide the bialys and the parchment onto the pizza stone. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for a few minutes (discard the parchment).
2. Serve immediately. Leftovers can be kept in an airtight plastic bag at room temperature for 2 days.

# Note

## **Windowpane test**

Whether you mix your dough in a mixer or by hand, the final check to make sure the gluten in your dough is properly developed is called the windowpane test. Tear off a small piece of dough about the size of a golf ball. If it is sticky, dredge it through a little extra flour to make it easy to handle. Use your hands to gently stretch the dough from all sides until it forms a thin, nearly transparent layer that you can see the light through if you old it up to an actual window or light. If you can stretch the dough to that state, it means the gluten is developed and your bread is ready to rise. Simply press the small dough ball back into the large one and proceed. If, on the other hand, your dough tears before you can stretch it thin enough to see the light through it, keep kneading it until it passes the test.
