**Ingredients**

- ½ litre milk
- 125g (4.5oz) flour
- 250g (9oz) sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 whole eggs
- 30g (1oz) butter + extra for greasing
- 1 vanilla pod or vanilla extract
- 10ml rum

**Method**

- Prepare the dough the day before, to allow time for it to rest in the fridge.
- Boil the milk with the open vanilla pod or extract. Leave to infuse until cool, then remove the pod if using, scraping out the seeds.
- In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, eggs, rum and melted but cooled butter. Mix everything well, and then add the cooled milk.
- Place the mixture in the fridge overnight.
- Remove the bowl from the fridge and give it a tap to shake up the mixture. Leave the bowl at room temperature for 30-60 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to its hottest temperature: 270 degrees.
- Butter the cannelé moulds and fill them three quarters full with the mixture.
- Bake for 10 minutes at maximum temperature, then reduce the heat to 200 degrees for a further 35-40 minutes. (This is for 4cm-high moulds. If you’re using smaller moulds, reduce the time.)
- The aim is to achieve a caramelised outside and a soft, airy centre. Enjoy!
