### Makes about 14 

# Ingredients

- 2 Tbsps vegetable oil (plus more for frying)
- 1 Tbsp active dry yeast
- 1½ cups warm water
- Juice of 1 orange (about ⅓ cup)
- 1 tsp orange zest
- ¾ tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp sugar
- 1 cup honey
- 3½ cups all-purpose flour

# Directions 

1. Combine flour, 1 Tbsp sugar, and salt in large bowl. Set aside. 
2. Pour½ cup water into another large bowl. Sprinkle remaining sugar and yeast over water. Let stand until mixture becomes foamy (about 10 minutes). 
3. Add flour mixture, remaining water, 3 Tbsps of orange juice, orange zest, and 2 Tbsps of oil to yeast mixture. Stir with wooden spoon to combine (about 30 seconds)
4. Knead dough with hands until smooth (about 1-2 minutes). Add additional flour (1 Tbsp at at time) to reduce stickiness. 
5. Remove dough and place in clean, lightly-oiled bowl. Cover with damp towel and let stand until dough is doubled in volume (about 60-90 minutes)
6. Heat about 4 inches of oil in large tall pot to about 350° F. 
7. Form dough into walnut-sized balls and drop in oil to fry in batches. Remove with slotted spoon when golden brown (about 3-4 minutes) and place on paper towel to drain. 
8. Combine honey and remaining orange juice in small saucepan. Simmer until warm (about 3-4 minutes). Pour over bimuelos to serve.
