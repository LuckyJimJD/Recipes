# Ingredients

- ½ litre milk
- 125g (4.5oz) flour
- 250g (9oz) sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 whole eggs
- 30g (1oz) butter + extra for greasing
- 1 vanilla pod or vanilla extract
- 10ml rum

# Directions 

1. Prepare the dough the day before, to allow time for it to rest in the fridge.
1. Boil the milk with the open vanilla pod or extract. Leave to infuse until cool, then remove the pod if using, scraping out the seeds.
1. In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, eggs, rum and melted but cooled butter. Mix everything well, and then add the cooled milk.
1. Place the mixture in the fridge overnight.
1. Remove the bowl from the fridge and give it a tap to shake up the mixture. Leave the bowl at room temperature for 30-60 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to its hottest temperature: 270° F.
1. Butter the cannelé moulds and fill them three quarters full with the mixture.
1. Bake for 10 minutes at maximum temperature, then reduce the heat to 200° F for a further 35-40 minutes. (This is for 4cm-high moulds. If you’re using smaller moulds, reduce the time.)
1. The aim is to achieve a caramelised outside and a soft, airy centre. Enjoy!
