- 120g (1 cup) powdered sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 40g (1⁄4 cup) raisins

## Maková Nádivka (Poppy seed filling )

- 1⁄3 cup milk
- 60g (1⁄2 cup) powdered sugar
- 1⁄4 cup raisins

## Drobenka (Streusel)

- 3 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature

# Directions

## Make the Dough 

1. In a large bowl, add dried yeast & 1 tsp sugar to lukewarm milk. Mix and let rise in a warm place (~80° F) for about 10 minutes. 
2. In a separate bowl, mix flour, remaining sugar, and lemon zest. Add softened butter & yeast mixture. Stir with wooden spoon to combine, then knead by hand until dough is smooth and not sticky. 
4. Sprinkle with flour, cover bowl with cloth, and let rise in a warm location (~80° F) for about an hour, until almost doubled. 

## Make the Fillings 

### Tvaroh 

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. 
2. Refrigerate until ready to use. 

### Poppy Seed

1. Grind poppy seeds with coffee grinder for about 30 seconds. 
2. Put ground seeds in a saucepan and add remaining ingredients. Stir over medium heat, bring to a boil, and heat for 2 minutes, continuing to stir. 
3. Remove from heat and let cool. 

### Crumb Topping 

1. Mix flour and sugar. 
2. Add butter and mix gently with hand until mixture forms crumbs.

## Shape and Bake 

1. Remove dough from bowl and work gently on a floured surface, without deflating too much. 
2. Divide dough into thirds and roll into oblong shape. Divide each third into six pieces (18 pieces total) and roll into balls. 
3. Place on lined baking sheet (6 pieces per sheet) and let rest for 10 minutes. 
4. Heat oven to 350° F. 
5. Dip the bottom of a glass in flour, then press hard onto each ball of dough to flatten, creating raised rim. 
6. Brush rims with egg, add filling and top with streusel. 
7. Bake for about 20 minutes, then place on rack to cool.
