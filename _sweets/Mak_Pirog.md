# Ingredients

## For the Dough 

- 6 tbsp. milk, heated to 115°, plus ⅓ cup
- 1 (¼-oz.) package active dry yeast
- ¼ cup canola oil, plus more for greasing
- 1 egg, plus 1 egg yolk
- 2 cups flour

## For the Filling 

- 3⁄4 cup ground poppy seeds
- 3 tbsp. unsalted butter
- Zest of½ lemon
- 1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tbsp. heavy cream, for egg wash
- Whole poppy seeds, to sprinkle on top

# Directions

## Dough

1. Whisk together 6 tbsp. heated milk and yeast in a bowl; let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Whisk in 1⁄4 cup sugar, the oil, 1 tsp. salt, and the egg and yolk; add flour, and stir until dough forms. Transfer to a floured work surface; knead until smooth, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let sit until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch down dough; cover, and let sit until puffed, about 1 hour.
2. Meanwhile, make the filling: Heat remaining milk, sugar, and salt, and ground poppy seeds, butter, and zest in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring, until thickened and smooth, about 4 minutes. Stir in vanilla, and let cool.
3. Heat oven to 350°. Punch down the dough, and halve it; transfer each half to a work surface and, using a rolling pin, flatten each into a 10″ x 14″ rectangle. Spread half the poppy seed filling over each rectangle and fold the longer sides 1″ toward the center; starting from one short side, fold up rectangles into 3″-4″-wide flat loaves. Transfer loaves, seam side down, to a parchment paper—lined baking sheet, and brush tops with egg wash; sprinkle top with whole poppy seeds. 
4. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
