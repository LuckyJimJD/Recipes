# Ingredients

## For the Topping

- 3½ cups (440g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp (5g) baking powder
- 1 tsp (5g) baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 tsp (8g) ground cinnamon
- ½ tsp ground cloves
- ½ tsp ground allspice
- 1 cup (235ml) vegetable oil
- 1 cup (340g) honey
- 1½ cups (300g) granulated sugar
- ½ cup (95g) brown sugar
- 3 large eggs at room temperature 
- 1 tsp (5ml) vanilla extract
- 1 cup (235ml) warm coffee or strong tea
- ½ cup (120ml) fresh orange juice
- ¼ cup (60ml) rye (or orange juice)
- ½ cup (45-55g) slivered or sliced almonds (optional)

# Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. 
2. Grease cake pan(s) (three loaf pans; two 9-inch square or round cake pans; one 9x13-inch sheet cake; or cannelés molds).
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. 
4. Make a well in the center and add the oil, honey, sugars, eggs, vanilla, coffee, orange juice, and rye or whisky.
5. Using a strong wire whisk or an electric mixer on slow speed, combine the ingredients well to make a thick batter, making sure that no ingredients are stuck to the bottom of the bowl.
6. Spoon the batter into pan(s) and sprinkle tops with almonds. Place on 2 baking sheets stacked together and bake until the cake springs back when you touch it gently in the center. 45 to 55 minutes for loaf pans; 40 to 45 minutes for sheet cake. 
7. Let cake rest for 15 minutes before removing it from the pan, then place on wire rack to cool.
