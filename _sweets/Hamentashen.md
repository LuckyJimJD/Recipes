# Ingredients


- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (room temperature) or vegetable oil (for parve)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- ¼ tsp salt
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 small lemon or 1/2 orange, zested & juiced

# Directions

1. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
2. In another bowl, cut butter into small pieces. Add sugar and cream together with an electric mixer for a few minutes till light and fluffy.
3. Add eggs, vanilla, and zest, then beat until creamy and well mixed.
4. Pour liquid mixture into flour, then mix at low speed until a soft dough forms, adding juice little by little so dough is neither too dry nor too sticky.
5. Knead dough by hand on a lightly-floured surface. Do not overwork the dough. If dough is too dry, add a little water; if it's too sticky, add some flour. 
6. Form the dough into a flat disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 3 hours to overnight.
7. Heat oven to 350° F. 
8. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to about ¼ inch thick, then cut into 3-inch circles. 
9. Place filling (1/2 to 1 tsp) in the center of each circle, then fold and pinch to form triangles. 
10. Bake on cookie sheet lines with parchment or baking mat for 20-25 minutes, until lightly golden. Place on wire rack to cool.
