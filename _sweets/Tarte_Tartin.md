# Ingredients 

## For the Shortcrust Pastry

- 180g (6.5oz) wheat flour
- 70g (2.5oz) unsalted butter
- 20g (¾ oz) cane sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1 egg

## For the Apple Topping

- 1.6kg (3.5lb) firm, tender-fleshed apples (neither floury nor crunchy, something in between)
- 80g (2.75oz) unsalted butter
- 120g (4.25oz) cane sugar

# Directions 

## Pastry

1. Combine the butter with the flour, sugar and salt by rubbing the mixture between your hands to obtain a fine powder, like a crumble.
2. Add the egg, kneading for as little time as possible. Add a touch of water if necessary. 
3. Form into a ball and refrigerate while preparing the apples.

## Caramel

1. In a 24cm diameter and 5cm deep Pyrex cooking dish, scatter the diced butter and sugar. 
2. Place the dish on the heat (with a heat diffuser if possible) and allow the butter and sugar to melt and simmer until a nicely golden caramel is obtained (about 20 minutes over moderate heat). 
3. Remove from heat.

## Apple topping

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. 
2. Cut the apples into quarters and remove the cores. 
3. Place a first layer of apples (curved side down) into the dish, packing them in tightly. 
4. Add a second layer of apples on top (curved side up). 
5. Fill in the gaps with the remaining apples, cutting the quarters in half if needed.
6. Bake for 20 minutes. By this point, the apples will be cooked and starting to be tinged with caramel.

## Assembly and baking

1. Remove the pastry dough from the fridge and roll it on a floured work surface to around 26cm in diameter. 
2. Place it over the apples, sliding a spatula along the edge of the dish to ensure the pastry touches the caramel. 
4. Pierce on both sides with a fork and bake for 25 minutes.

## Caramel reduction

1. The tart can be served like this, but the caramel is still too runny. To thicken it, put the dish back on the heat and cook over a low heat for 20 minutes, watching carefully.
2. Let it cool thoroughly.
