# Ingredients

- 1 cup (140g) almond or hazelnut flour
- 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (180g) sugar
- 5 tablespoons (45g) flour
- generous pinch salt
- 4 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract
- 2 1/2 ounces (75g) brown butter, slightly warm (liquified)

# Directions

## Brown Butter 

1. In a heavy saucepan, heat butter gently over low heat until completely melted, stirring with rubber spatula
2. Once butter is melted and begins to bubble, place a screen on top of the saucepan to prevent splatters and continue heating (adjust flame to keep temperature above 212° F), swirling pan & stirring with spatula occasstionally to ensure all bubbles are released. 
3. When butter starts to foam (after about 5 minutes), stir continuously with rubber spatula to prevent milk solids from sticking to bottom the the pan. Only the milk solids will brown, appearing as dark specks and giving a nutty aroma. The fat will darken slightly. 
4. Once butter has browned, pour into a heatproof bowl & stir for 1-2 minutes to help it cool. 


## Batter 

1. Preheat the oven to 375ºF/180ºC and butter the insides of 24 mini muffin tins generously with softened, not melted, butter, making sure the butter the upper rims of the indentations.
2. In a medium bowl, mix the almond or hazelnut powder, sugar, flour and salt. Stir in the egg whites and vanilla or almond extract, then the browned butter.
3. Fill each indentation of the mini muffin tins almost to the top. Rap the tins sharply on the counter to level the tops, then bake for 13 minutes, until nicely browned. Let the financiers cool in the tins, then remove them, using a sharp knife to help release them, if necessary.
