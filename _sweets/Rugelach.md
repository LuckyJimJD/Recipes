# Ingredients

## Dough

- 1 package active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons sugar
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 8 ounces butter or pareve margarine, melted
- 2 large eggs, well beaten

# Directions

1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in Â¼ cup warm water. Add 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Stir well and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Sift the flour and remaining sugar into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the cooled butter or margarine. Add the eggs and yeast mixture. Mix together all ingredients thoroughly and form into a ball. Cover and put in the refrigerator overnight.
3. The next morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator and uncover for about 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease 2 cookie sheets.
5. Divide the dough into 5 equal parts and mix the cinnamon and sugar. Cover a hard surface with the cinnamon and sugar. Flour the rolling pin and roll out each piece of dough into a 9-inch circle. Spread with some of the apricot preserves and sprinkle with the raisins. Cut into 10 wedges and roll each wedge from the wide end to the point. Curve to make a crescent, making sure the points are on the bottom.
5. Put the crescents on the cookie sheets. Bake until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the cookie sheet immediately or they will stick. Rugelach freeze very well.
