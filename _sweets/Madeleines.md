# Ingredients

- 5 eggs
- 250 g (1 cup + 1½ Tbsp) granulated sugar
- 250g (8.8 oz) butter
- 250 g (2 cups all-purpose flour
- 12 g (1⅓ tsp) chestnut or other honey
- ½ vanilla bean or ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract 
- 10 g (2 tsp) baking powder
- zest of ½ lemon

# Directions 

1. Melt butter, being careful not to let it burn, Let it cool to 120 F/50 C.
2. Place eggs, granulated sugar, honey, and scraped seeds of half of the vanilla bean (or half the vanilla extract) in a bowl and beat with a hand whisk. 
3. Sift flour and baking powder with a flour sifter, add to the mixture and combine with a whisk. 
4. Add butter and whisk again. 
5. Zest half of a lemon with a zester grater, add to the main preparation and mix. 
6. Cover the batter with a plastic film on contact and refrigerate overnight, or even better for 24 hours. The plastic wrap must touch the batter, and not cover the bowl.
7. Preheat oven to 425 F/220 C. 
8. Butter cavities of a madeleine mold. 
9. Using a pastry bag, add batter to the cavities up to ¾ full.
10. Bake at 425 F/220 C for 3 minutes. Then switch off the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. The madeleines will get that famous bump on top. Turn the oven to 320 F/160 C for the other 3 to 4 minutes.
11. Remove madeleines from the oven and cool in the mold for 5 minutes. 
12. Remove them one by one, simply pushing each cavity from the bottom. Let madeleines rest on their sides, still in the mold, so that they completely cool (do not use a wire rack).
