My mom would make Dutch Baby [Pancakes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-and-fluffy-german-pancake-428363) on Sunday mornings when I was a kid. They were a delicious and easy pancake that she could make in under twenty minutes. She would pull the iron skillet out of the oven and their beautiful fluffy edges would balloon over the sides of the pan. They look so beautiful and impressive. They are kind of like a [crepe](https://www.thespruceeats.com/norwegian-pancakes-4066282) and a popover had a baby. The Dutch Baby will start deflating almost immediately after you take it out of the oven, but the beautiful golden crust and fluffy interior will remain effortlessly delicious and will melt in your mouth.

I love that it only takes one bowl and one pan to make this breakfast. It has the potential to feed four, but my husband and I usually finish it ourselves, it's just too good! You can serve it right out of the cast iron skillet. You can also make this pancake in a casserole dish or other oven proof pan. I think the cast iron lends to a nice flavor and helps create the beautiful golden crust, but it is not necessary if you do not have one.

This Dutch Baby uses vanilla sugar, lemon zest and a tangy lemon glaze. The lemon really complements the eggy flavor of the pancake. You can easily make it with other flavors or add fresh fruit after it has cooked. But I just adore [lemon pancakes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/blueberry-lemon-ricotta-pancakes-4025480). They just seem to go together so well! These pancakes are best served immediately. They do not reheat well and are not as good when served cold. Make sure you are ready to eat when you pop it in the oven. When you pull it out, serve it immediately with an extra helping of the lemon glaze and a little powdered sugar!
