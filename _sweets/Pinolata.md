# Directions

1. Prepare the pastry. 

Using a stand mixer with whisk attachment, combine flour and cold butter (chopped in pieces) for a few seconds until grainy. Add sugar, eggs, and lemon peel and mix until thoroughly combined. Roll dough into a cylinder in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 30 minutes. 

2. Prepare the custard.

Pour milk and lemon peel into small saucepan. Cook over a low flame until it just begins to boil. 

Combine the flour and starch in a small bowl. Whisk the eggs and yolk in a separate bowl, then add sugar. When sugar has absorbed the liquid, add the flour & startch mixture. 

When the milk has cooled, remove the skin and add the egg mixture. Cook over a low flame, stirring continuously with a whisk until the liquid thickens (about 10-15 minutes). Pour custard into a large glass dish and cover with plastic wrap so that the plastic touches the custard. Let it cool at room temperature. 

4. Assemble and bake. . 

Heat oven to 320°F (180° C). 

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out into a circle about 2-3 mm thick.  

Coat a pie dish with butter then dust with flour. Roll the dough onto a rolling pin, then place in the pie mold. Press the dough with fingers around the sides and remove the excess. 

Pierce the dough in the bottom of the pie pan with a fork, then pour in the custard. 

Form remaining dough into a circle to cover the custard. Piece the top with a fork and sprinkle with pine nuts and powdered sugar. 

Bake for 50 minutes at 320°F (180° C), then increase temperature to 360°F (180° C)
