# Ingredients

## For **Stiff Sourdough Starter**

- 25 g sourdough starter
- 200 g bread flour
- 100 g water (70 to 90°F)

## **Dough**

- 200 g bread flour
- 154 g water (70 to 90°F)
- 150 g stiff sourdough starter
- 1 tsp (6 g) salt

# Directions

## Stiff Sourdough Starter

1. **First feeding:** Add 50 g flour and 25 g water to 25 g sourdough starter. Mix and knead until all the flour is absorbed. Oil the top, cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise at 75°to 80°F until it has doubled, 6 to 8 hours.
2. **Second feeding:** Add 100 g flour and 50 g water to 50 g of the starter. Mix, cover, and let rise 6 to 8 hours until doubled. If not using immediately, refrigerate (up to 20 hours) and remove 1 hour before mixing the dough.
3. **Storage starter:** Feed remaining starter with 50 g flour and 25 g water. Let sit at room temperature for 30-60 minutes, then store in refrigerator for future use. 

## Dough

1. **Mix the dough**
    - If you have refrigerated the starter, remove it to room temperature 1 hour before mixing the dough.
    - Put flour in mixer bowl. Run mixer with dough hook on low speed (KitchenAid #2), gradually adding water until the flour is moistened enough to form a rough dough. Continue kneading on low speed for 3 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little. Scrape down any bits of dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes.
    - Add 150 g of the stiff starter (discard remainder) and knead for about 2 minutes.
    - Add the salt and continue kneading for 1 minute.
    - Raise the speed to medium (KitchenAid #4) and knead for 3 minutes. The dough will be barely tacky (sticky), smooth, and very elastic. If it is still very sticky, knead in a little flour. If it is not at all sticky, spray it with a little water and knead it. (The dough will measure about 2 cups and weigh about 17.7 ounces/502 grams.)
2. **Let the dough rise**
    - Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover and allow dough to rise for 1 hour at 75°to 80°F. It will only rise slightly.
    - Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently push it down to deflate it, stretch it into a rectangle, and make 2 business letter turns. The dough will be soft and stretchy but a little firmer after each turn.
    - Return the dough to the greased container and lightly spray or oil the top. Cover and allow it to rise for another hour.
    - Stretch and turn the dough again, then return it to the container, cover, and allow it to rise until doubled, 4 to 5 hours.
3. **Shape the dough and let it rise**
    - Without deflating it, turn the dough out onto a floured counter and round it into a ball. Set it in a floured banneton or a colander lined with a floured towel, seam side up. Pinch together the seam if it starts to pull apart.
    - In the banneton, the dough will be about 2 inches from the top. Spray the dough with oil or sprinkle lightly with flour, cover, and let rise 75° to 80°F until almost doubled, 3 to 4 hours.
    - When dough is pressed gently with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill in. In the banneton, the center of the dough should be 3/4 to 1 inch from the top.
4. **Prepare the oven**
    - Place oven stone or baking sheet on oven rack at lowest level.
    - Place cast-iron skillet or sheet pan on the floor of the oven.
    - Preheat the oven to 475°F 1 hour before baking.
5. **Slash and bake the dough**
    - Very gently invert the dough onto a lined baking sheet.
    - Gently, without deflating the dough, make a 1/4-deep slash (X-shaped or 3-5 parallel lines) on top.
    - Set the baking sheet on the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet.
    - Toss 1/2 cup of ice cubes into the pan beneath and immediately shut the door.
    - Bake for 5 minutes. Lower the oven to 450°F and continue baking for 10 minutes. If using a stone, lift bread with spatula and set it directly on the stone, rotating it for even baking.
    - Continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the crust is deeply burnished. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 212°F when loaf is done.
    - For a very crisp crust, prop the open door slightly ajar for the last 5 minutes of baking.
    - Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
