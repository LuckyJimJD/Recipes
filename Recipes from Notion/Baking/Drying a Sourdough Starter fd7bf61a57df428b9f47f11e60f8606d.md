## **1. Ready your sourdough starter for storage.**

First, feed your starter as though you were going to bake with it. If it's been stored in the fridge, take it out, and feed it with equal parts [unbleached all-purpose flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/king-arthur-unbleached-all-purpose-flour-5-lb) and lukewarm water. Let it rest, covered, until it becomes very bubbly and healthy looking.

## 2. Spread it out to dry.

Next, spread it – all of it* – onto two pieces of [parchment](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/baking-parchment-paper-set-of-100-half-sheets). It helps to set each piece of parchment on a baking sheet, simply for ease of transportation.

The starter should be spread as thinly as possible; use a spatula, an offset spatula, or a bowl scraper to help the process along.

## 3. Dry the starter completely, until it's brittle.

Let the starter dry at room temperature until it's completely and utterly dry. This may take several days, depending on the humidity and temperature.

Completely dry starter should peel easily off the parchment; when you pick a piece up, it will be brittle and easily snap between your fingers. If you have a scale, weigh it; if you started with 4 ounces starter on your parchment, it should weigh 2 ounces (or very close) when it's completely dry.

## 4. Break it into pieces.

Break the starter into small chips with your hands; or place it in a plastic bag and pulverize it with something heavy.

## 5. Store it airtight.

Store the starter airtight, preferably in a glass container. You want something totally inert, with an airtight cover; a glass jar is perfect. Date the jar and label it; you don't want someone throwing it away during the course of some pantry spring cleaning.

Keep the jar of dried starter in a cool, dark place, if possible. Do not refrigerate. 

## 6. Bring your sourdough starter back to life.

When you're ready to revive the starter, measure out 1 ounce (or about 1/8 of it, if you'd been following a regular feeding pattern and had about 8 ounces starter on hand at the beginning of the drying process).

Don't have a scale? Well, depending on the size of your chips, this will be between 1/4 and 1/3 cup.

## 7. Mix the starter with lukewarm water.

Place the dried starter chips in a large (at least 1-pint) container. Add 2 ounces (1/4 cup) of lukewarm water. The water should barely cover the chips; tamp them down, if necessary.

Stir the chips/water occasionally; it'll take 3 hours or so, with infrequent attention, to dissolve the chips.

## 8. Feed it with flour.

Once the mixture is fairly smooth/liquid, with perhaps just a couple of small undissolved chips, feed it with 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) of unbleached all-purpose flour. Cover it lightly (a shower cap works well here), and place it somewhere warm (ideally about 85° to 90°F).

## 9. Let it rest somewhere warm until it bubbles.

Let the starter work for 24 hours. At the end of that time, you should see some bubbles starting to form. Remember, this is at about 85°F; if your temperature is lower, this will take longer.

## 10. Feed the twice more without discarding any.

WITHOUT DISCARDING ANY OF THE STARTER, feed it with 1 ounce of lukewarm water, and 1 ounce of flour. Cover, and put back in its warm spot. After "X" hours (depends on your kitchen), you should see some serious bubbling; mine took eight hours to become nice and bubbly.

## 11. Put the starter back on its regular feeding schedule.

Your starter is ready to return to its former life – and its regular schedule. DISCARD all but 4 ounces (about 1/2 cup). Feed it again, this time with **4 ounces each lukewarm water and flour.** 

This time, it should really expand quickly. In my 85°F oven, it took just 4 hours for it to triple in size. Your starter is now revived and healthy.

## 12. The starter is now ready for use.

To ready the starter for baking (while saving enough for another day), feed it again. Discard all but 4 ounces; and feed the remainder with 4 ounces each lukewarm water and flour. Let it become bubbly – and let the baking begin!
