If youâ€™ve never roasted broccoli rabe, this recipe will be a revelation. The high heat renders the stems and florets tender while the leaves crisp around the edges, like kale chips but with a spicy broccoli bite. Make sure not to crowd the pan or everything will steam rather than roast. This recipe will also work with regular broccoli. Cut the head up into bite-sized pieces and add 5 to 10 minutes to the cooking time.
